  Just had Kevin hot pressure washed my back patio. I tried doing myself but
  there is a difference between home depot products and professional products.
  Between the professional cleaners and the 200 plus degree pressure wash the
  patio looks like new again. What a great job and thank you!

  Kevin did an awesome job of cleaning calcium off of large fountains in our
  community. He did the job that no one else could seem to accomplish. They now
  look beautiful again! Like new! So grateful. Highly recommend!
